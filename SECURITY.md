# **Security and Minimalism Intent** - dijson

**dijson** is designed with two key principles in mind: **security** and **minimalism**.

## Security

An effort has been made to ensure that **dijson** is **thread-safe** and **memory-safe**. By using **atomic operations** and **static memory allocation**, we minimize the risk of race conditions and memory-related vulnerabilities. The library avoids dynamic memory allocation and ensures all buffers are managed safely to prevent common issues like buffer overflows or use-after-free.

## Minimalism

We believe that simplicity leads to security. **dijson** follows a minimalist approach, keeping the codebase small, readable, and easy to audit. By reducing complexity, we ensure that the library remains fast, efficient, and easy to understand while maintaining robust security.

This approach makes **dijson** an ideal json parsing solution for projects where both performance and safety are critical, without sacrificing simplicity.
